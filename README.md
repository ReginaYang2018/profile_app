This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

1. After downloading the most recent Node.js, you can run
### 'sudo npm i -g create-react-app@version no.' 
to install the package to create a new React app

2. To create a React project, you can run
### 'create-react-app AppName'


3. In the react project directory, you can run:

### 'npm start'

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

3. In order to to import react-bootstrap and react-router-dom, you will need to install react-bootstrap, which can be obtained by running 'npm i bootstrap@version no.'
and react-router-dom, which can be obtained by running 'npm install --save react-router-dom' 

4. I create an extra function called 'Add User' which allows you to add new user.
